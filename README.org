#+title: Aerospace Move

This repo is intended to contain a binary for batching up move commands in =aerospace= on MacOS.

This is necessary as it does not yet support workspace allocations for specific apps. On call, it should
move all windows that match configured rules for a workspace to that appropriate workspace.

Tools should expect to consume configuration that contains move rules in ~${XDG_HOME}/aerospace/aerospace-move~ on local machine.
* Implement list
- [X] come up with config schema
  - tested - generally will validate a yaml input
- [X] implement and test way to queue up and fire off space move commands
  - (is there a delay required? is there in built method?)
  - nope, works out of the box - yabai handles many quick commands
- [X] minimal implementation consuming and validating config schema
- [X] logic
  - can't try to put a single window id in 2 places - fail early if multiple matches happens
- [X] implement matching on title regex and app regex
- [X] refresh as aerospace-move
- [ ] implement launcher
  - [ ] mvp version can be a fzf terminal window script
- [ ] schema implement optional fields
  - if any one of window rule fields is specified, use it
  - if multiple are specified, apply them
  - should be one of (app | appRegex) |
  - can't have title + titleRegex or app + appregex
  - every other combo, there or not is ok
